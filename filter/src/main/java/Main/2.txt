Jane Austen was one of the distinguished realistic novelists in the nineteenth- century-English literature．Pride and Prejudice is a world wide popular novel published in 1813．Austen set the story in the first decade of the nineteenth century．At that time，marriage was the only way for women to gain social status and recognition. The author of the present thesis will analyze the five marriage patterns from the perspective of sociohistorical literary criticism to explore the important role that money and love plays in marriage. It can be seen clearly that Austen fully expresses her original views on marriage：property, social status and love are three indispensable elements in a marriage．It is wrong to marry for money，but it is unwise to marry without money. Austen’s views on marriage emphasize love and economic condition, but love plays the significant role，which is the predominant aspect at Austen’s time. The thesis tries to draw some inspiration from Austen and provide some hints for modern women in their view of marriage, and add something new into the literary criticism of the great work of Jane Austen.
